# Stardew TODO

Stardew is an incredible game createdby Concern Ape that involes the user becomgn a farmer. I've put an embrassing amount of hours in this game and one thing I always need when I play is a todo list for the things i need to forage and do for my farm. So after feeling inspired by the newest update I decided to create that todo app.
